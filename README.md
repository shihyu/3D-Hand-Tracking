# 3D Hand Tracking

## Introduction

In the field of image processing, hand/finger tracking is a high-resolution technique that is employed to know the consecutive position of the hands/fingers of the user and hence represent objects in 3D. In addition to that, the hand/finger tracking technique is used as a tool of the computer, acting as an external device in our computer, similar to a keyboard and a mouse.

## Device Support

Microsoft Kinect is a device to capture not only the color information of the environment but also the depth information. With the support of Kinect using the depth camera, we can tracking and recognize human hands by color and depth information.

## Brief

We will use Microsoft Kinect v2 for this project. Detecting the human hand in a real time environment should be the baseline of this project. More feature will be considered and added if we have enough time.

## Progress

- Install Kinect v2 SDK and development environment is Done and Test the environment is Done. 2016-05-26
